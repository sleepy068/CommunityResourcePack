		<Text>The Philadelphia chromosome or Philadelphia translocation (Ph) is a specific genetic abnormality in chromosome 22 of leukemia cancer cells (particularly chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) cells). The chromosomal defect in the Philadelphia chromosome is a reciprocal translocation, in which parts of two chromosomes, 9 and 22, swap places. The presence of this translocation is a highly sensitive test for CML, since most cases of CML are positive.</Text>

The expression of this receptor in human B cells has been a controversial topic and up to date there is no consensus regarding the role of this receptor as a marker of human B cells. CD5 is a good immunohistochemical marker for T-cells, although not as sensitive as CD3. About 76% of T-cell neoplasms are reported to express CD5, and it is also found in chronic lymphocytic leukemia and mantle cell lymphoma (both being B cell malignancies), that do not express CD3. It is commonly lost in cutaneous T-cell lymphoma, and its absence can be used as an indicator of malignancy in this condition.</Text>

It is usually considered myeloid-specific, but it can also be found on some lymphoid cells. CD33 can be stimulated by any molecule with sialic acid residues such as glycoproteins or glycolipids. Upon binding, the immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibition motif (ITIM) of CD33, present on the cytosolic portion of the protein, is phosphorylated and acts as a docking site for Src homology 2 (SH2) domain-containing proteins like SHP phosphatases. This results in a cascade that inhibits phagocytosis in the cell.</Text>

		<Text>In immunology, the CD3 (cluster of differentiation 3) T cell co-receptor helps to activate both the cytotoxic T cell (CD8+ naive T cells) and also T helper cells (CD4+ naive T cells). CD3 is initially expressed in the cytoplasm of pro-thymocytes, the stem cells from which T-cells arise in the thymus. The pro-thymocytes differentiate into common thymocytes, and then into medullary thymocytes, and it is at this latter stage that CD3 antigen begins to migrate to the cell membrane. The antigen is found bound to the membranes of all mature T-cells, and in virtually no other cell type, although it does appear to be present in small amounts in Purkinje cells. This high specificity, combined with the presence of CD3 at all stages of T-cell development, makes it a useful immunohistochemical marker for T-cells in tissue sections.

These receptors bind to the Fc portion of IgG antibodies, which then activates antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) in human NK cells. CD16 is required for ADCC processes carried out by human monocytes. In humans, monocytes expressing CD16 have a variety of ADCC capabilities in the presence of specific antibodies, and can kill primary leukemic cells, cancer cell lines, and cells infected with hepatitis B virus.

Women who carry a fault in BRCA1 or BRCA2 have a high lifetime risk of breast cancer, estimated to be in the range of 30-60%, and a lifetime ovarian cancer risk of about 20%.

This mutation appears to be specific for glioblastoma multiforme and is found rarely in other tumour grades. This mutation is associated with poor survival. LOH at 10q plus 1 or 2 of the additional gene mutations appear to be frequent alterations and are most likely major players in the development of glioblastomas.</Text>

		<Text>Platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) is one among numerous growth factors that regulate cell growth and division. In particular, PDGF plays a significant role in blood vessel formation, the growth of blood vessels from already-existing blood vessel tissue, mitogenesis, i.e. proliferation, of mesenchymal cells. In Oncology, the PDGF gene acts as a major mitogen for glial cells by binding to the PDGF receptor (PDGFR). Amplification or overexpression of PDGFR is typical in the pathway leading to secondary glioblastomas.</Text>

		<Text>CD30, also known as TNFRSF8, is a cell membrane protein of the tumour necrosis factor receptor family and tumour marker. This receptor is expressed by activated, but not by resting, T and B cells. TRAF2 and TRAF5 can interact with this receptor, and mediate the signal transduction that leads to the activation of NF-kappaB. CD30 is associated with anaplastic large cell lymphoma. It is expressed in embryonal carcinoma but not in seminoma and is thus a useful marker in distinguishing between these germ cell tumours. CD30 and CD15 are also expressed on Reed-Sternberg cells typical for Hodgkin's lymphoma.</Text>

PTPRC is also known as CD45 antigen (CD stands for cluster of differentiation), which was originally called leukocyte common antigen (LCA). CD45 is a pan-leukocyte protein with tyrosine phosphatase activity involved in the regulation of signal transduction in hematopoiesis. CD45 does not colocalize with lipid rafts on murine and human non-transformed hematopoietic cells, but CD45 positioning within lipid rafts is modified during their oncogenic transformation to acute myeloid leukemia.</Text>

		<Text>B-cell lymphoma 6 protein is a protein that in humans is encoded by the BCL6 gene. Like BCL2, BCL3, BCL5, BCL7A, BCL9 and BCL10, it has clinical significance in lymphoma. The protein encoded by this gene is an evolutionarily conserved zinc finger transcription factor and contains an N-terminal POZ/BTB domain. This protein acts as a sequence-specific repressor of transcription and has been shown to modulate the STAT-dependent Interleukin 4 (IL-4) responses of B cells. This protein can interact with several corepressor complexes to inhibit transcription. This gene is found to be frequently translocated and hypermutated in diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL).</Text>

Antibodies to Bcl-2 can be used with immunohistochemistry to identify cells containing the antigen. In healthy tissue, these antibodies react with B-cells in the mantle zone, as well as some T-cells. However, positive cells increase considerably in follicular lymphoma, as well as many other forms of cancer.

The presence of MSI represents phenotypic evidence that MMR is not functioning normally. MMR corrects errors that spontaneously occur during DNA replication, such as single base mismatches or short insertions and deletions. The proteins involved in MMR correct polymerase errors by forming a complex that binds to the mismatched section of DNA, excises the error, and inserts the correct sequence in its place. Cells with abnormally functioning MMR are unable to correct errors that occur during DNA replication and consequently accumulate errors. Microsatellite instability is associated with many forms of cancer but is most prevalent in associations with colon cancers.</Text>

		<Text>Mucin 6, oligomeric mucus/gel-forming, also known as MUC6, is a human gene. In extrahepatic bile duct lesions (biliary IPMNs), MUC2 expression parallels the degree of columnar-cell change and intestinal differentiation, whereas MUC6 is characteristically positive in tumors with a cuboidal-cell pattern and in cases with pyloric or biliary differentiation. Pyloric gland adenomas (of the gallbladder) are consistently positive for MUC6, as well as other pyloric gland markers, such as M-GGMC-1.</Text>

		<Text>Napsin A is a functional aspartic proteinase, expressed in the cytoplasm of healthy lung parenchyma. It is homologous with the polypeptide TAO2 and involved in maturation of the biologically active surfactant protein B. It also consists of a 38-kDa protein, a single-chain protein expressed in type II pneumocytes, alveolar macrophages, renal tubules, and exocrine glands and ducts in the pancreas. Napsin A may be an alternative marker for primary lung cancer.</Text>

		<Text>Alpha-fetoprotein is a protein that in humans is encoded by the AFP gene. The AFP gene is located on the q arm of chromosome 4. AFP is a major plasma protein produced by the yolk sac and the fetal liver during fetal development. AFP is found mainly in liver cancer and nonseminomatous germ cell tumors, which are rare. These are found in the pineal gland in the brain. Some people with cirrhosis or chronic active hepatitis also have higher blood levels of AFP. Like any elevated tumor marker, elevated AFP by itself is not diagnostic, only suggestive.</Text>

		<Text>Hepatocyte paraffin 1 is a monoclonal antibody that has been developed specifically to react with hepatocytes in routine formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded surgical pathology tissues. It results in a distinct, granular cytoplasmic staining of hepatocytes but fails to react with bile ducts and nonparenchymal liver cells. The antibody decorates a majority of hepatocellular carcinomas, including fibrolamellar variants. It fails to react with a wide variety of other adult malignancies, with the exception of focal staining in a few gastrointestinal malignancies, including a subpopulation of gastric carcinomas.</Text>
