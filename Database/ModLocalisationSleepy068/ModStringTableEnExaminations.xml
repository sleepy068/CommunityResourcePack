			<Text>A Cancer Antigen (CA) test is a blood test used to help diagnose and manage certain types of cancers. Tumour markers are substances, usually proteins, that are produced by the body in response to cancer growth or by the cancer tissue itself. Some tumour markers are specific for one type of cancer, while others are seen in several cancer types. Many of the well-known markers are seen in non-cancerous conditions as well as cancer. Consequently, they cannot be used to diagnose cancer. \n\nRequired Lab: Haematology</Text>

			<Text>Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) is a molecular cytogenetic technique that uses fluorescent probes that bind to only those parts of a nucleic acid sequence with a high degree of sequence complementarity. It was developed by biomedical researchers in the early 1980s to detect and localize the presence or absence of specific DNA sequences on chromosomes. Fluorescence microscopy can be used to find out where the fluorescent probe is bound to the chromosomes. FISH is often used for finding specific features in DNA for use in genetic counseling, medicine, and species identification. FISH can also be used to detect and localize specific RNA targets (mRNA, lncRNA and miRNA) in cells, circulating tumor cells, and tissue samples. \n\nRequired Lab: Histology</Text>

			<Text>A colonoscopy is a medical procedure that is done to look for cancer, colon polyps or other abnormalities inside your bowel. Colonoscopy is done using an instrument called a colonoscope (a type of endoscope) — a long, thin, flexible tube containing a camera and a light. During the colonoscopy, the doctor passes an instrument through the colonoscope to obtain a biopsy (a small sample of the colon lining) to be further analysed.</Text>
