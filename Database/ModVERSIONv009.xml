Update v0.0.9
Last Patcher? Sleepy068

Changes:
Restructured Mod Files (better organised now)
Restructured XML Content (visually better and now easier to navigate, lots needs to be polished but it is a good start)

Symptom Changes:
Changed Examination for SYM_CRP_COLONOFIND from EXM_CRP_COLONOSCOPY_BIOPSY_SAMPLE to EXM_CRP_COLONOSCOPY (The old exam did not work how it was intended, was suppose to find during sampling)
